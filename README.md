This project aims to provide a comprehensive algorithm visualization tool for educational and learning purposes. The tool is designed to help users understand complex algorithms by visualizing their execution step-by-step.

## Features

* **Algorithm Visualization**: The tool allows users to visualize the execution of various algorithms, including sorting, searching, graph traversal, and more.
* **Interactive Interface**: Users can interact with the visualization by adjusting parameters, such as input data, to see how the algorithm behaves under different conditions.
* **Real-time Feedback**: The tool provides real-time feedback on the algorithm's performance, including execution time and memory usage.
* **Multi-Language Support**: The tool supports multiple programming languages, allowing users to visualize algorithms implemented in languages they are familiar with.
* **Extensive Algorithm Library**: The tool includes a comprehensive library of algorithms, covering a wide range of topics and difficulty levels.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.

## Technical Details

* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Backend**: The backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
* **Database**: The tool uses a database to store algorithm implementations, user data, and other relevant information.
* **Deployment**: The tool is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.
